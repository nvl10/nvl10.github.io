Soon after the new term begins, I've received kinds of paintings from the kids. "Miss Li, this is the you I painted", I can also receive a smiled face when they hand over the pictures. 
I always carefully preserved these paintings in a drawer. Sometimes when I look over these paintings, their tender faces will flash out in my brain.
