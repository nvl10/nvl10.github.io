A good class is not just mindlessly instilling knowldges by teachers. 
I've been thinking that students themselves is always the main body for a course, so it will benefit a lot if we can level enough class time for children so that they can feel, can interact learning itself.
In the picture, we are learning the course "Oral Communication -- how to make friends", in which these kids are trying to make friends by kinds of DIY name cards.
This is far more effective than just orally teach them something like "a good way of making friends".
